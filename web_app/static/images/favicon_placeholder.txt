üèôÔ∏è NYC Property Investment ML - Favicon Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the website favicon. 

To add a proper favicon:
1. Go to https://favicon.io/ 
2. Create a favicon with "NYC" text or building icon
3. Use blue (#0d6efd) background to match the app theme
4. Download the generated favicon.ico file
5. Replace this file with favicon.ico

The HTML template is already configured to use favicon.ico from this directory.

For now, the website will use the browser's default icon.
